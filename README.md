For this assignment, I wrote two small programs that work with lists, loops, and basic numeric operations. In the first problem, I created two lists to store sales amounts and the days of the week. I used the max() function to find the highest sales value, found its index in the list, and then used that same index to display the corresponding day. This shows that I understand how list indexing works and how two lists can be linked by position. In the second problem, I built a loop that keeps collecting numbers from the user until they enter 0. All valid inputs are stored in a list, and then I manually determine the maximum and minimum values using a simple loop. From there, I calculated the range by subtracting the smallest number from the largest. This part of the program demonstrates list building, loop control, input handling, and using basic logic to compute a value without relying on built-in functions.
